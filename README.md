# Process Flow Visualization Tool for Audit Logs

This tool analyzes and visualizes process relationships, behaviors, and timelines from Linux audit logs generated by auditbeat. It creates visualizations showing process hierarchies, process timelines, suspicious activities, and security alerts.

## Features

- Parses auditbeat NDJSON log files
- Builds process hierarchy trees and activity timelines
- Identifies suspicious process behaviors and security concerns
- Generates visualizations using Mermaid.js
- Provides multiple visualization views:
  - Process Tree View: Shows hierarchical relationships
  - Timeline View: Shows process activities over time
- Color-coded process classification:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Root processes (PID 1)
  - ðŸ”µ Blue: Normal processes
  - ðŸŸ  Orange: Privileged processes (running as root)
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Suspicious processes

## Security Analysis

The tool performs security analysis:

### Process Name Analysis
- Detection of hex-encoded and obfuscated names
- Recognition of known suspicious process names
- Identification of attack indicators
- Analysis of unusual character distributions
- Detection of Unicode/non-ASCII characters

### Behavior Analysis
- System call pattern analysis
- Privilege escalation attempts
- File system operations
- Network activity patterns
- Process manipulation
- Resource usage patterns

### Security Alerts
- Suspicious execution patterns
- Failed operations
- Privilege abuse
- Network abuse patterns
- File system tampering
- Command injection attempts

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/toopieare/CS5231_Proj.git
cd CS5231_Proj
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Place your auditbeat log file in the `input` directory and update config.py to indicate the correct filename
2. Run the tool:
```bash
python main.py
```

3. View the visualizations:
- Open `output/process_flow.html` for the process hierarchy view
- Open `output/process_gantt.html` for the timeline view

## Understanding the Visualizations

### Process Tree View
- Shows hierarchical relationships between processes
- Indicates process states and security concerns
- Provides detailed process information and alerts
- Color-coded for quick status identification

### Timeline View
- Shows process lifetimes and activities
- Groups processes by type and behavior
- Indicates activity levels and suspicious patterns
- Provides temporal context for process behaviors

### Edge Types
- Normal edges (-->) indicate standard relationships
- Bold edges (==>) indicate suspicious process relationships
- Red nodes indicate security concerns
- Orange nodes indicate privileged operations
